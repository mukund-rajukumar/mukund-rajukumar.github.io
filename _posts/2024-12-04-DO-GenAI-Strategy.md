*Disclaimer: This strategy is a draft proposal from my quick research on the company based on publicly available information. This will require further refining*

## Company Summary
Digital Ocean empowers developers, startups and tech SMBs with a simple and affordable cloud platform, so customers can focus more on innovation and not on managing their cloud infrastructure.

## Mission and Goals
- Simplify and democratize access to GenAI capabilities
- Grow adoption AI/ML infrastructure, targeting startups and SMBs

## GenAI Customer Segmentation
1. GenAI Developers/Providers
   1. Independent developers/startups creating GenAI tools or applications
   2. ML engineers and AI researchers focused on lightweight, cost-effective AI/ML deployment
2. GenAI Consumers
   1. Non GenAI Savvy SMBs needing AI solutions without in-house expertise
   2. GenAI Savvy SMBs looking to deploy or optimize AI/ML workloads affordably
3. Ecosystem Partners
   1. Open source model communities: Meta Llama, Falcon, Mistral, Hugging Face etc.
   2. Proprietary LLM providers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic
   3. GPU/Server/Networking hardware suppliers: Nvidia, Intel, AMD, SuperMicro etc.
   4. Infra software providers: Linux, K8s etc

## Unmet Needs
I have picked top 2 customer segments from the above list to understand their unmet needs.

*Non GenAI Savvy GenAI solution consumers (Existing DO customers)*
  1. I hear a lot of buzz but I don’t know how GenAI can add value to my business (beyond using ChatGPT)
  2. I have a GenAI idea to improve my business but I don’t know how to productize it.

*ML Engineers (New DO customers)*
  1. Struggle to decide the best model for their use-case
  2. Shortage of data to train the model for my use-cases. Data collection is laborious
  3. Model training takes a long time and is very expensive
  4. Model testing is actual customer environments is time-consuming and delays my launch
  5. Implementation of multimodal use-cases is a big challenge
  6. How do I make best use of AI agents for my business
  7. Worried about losing customer trust because of GenAI hallucination or irresponsible use of AI
