   1. ML Engineers
   2. Research scientists
   3. AI startups
2. GenAI solution/application consumers
   1. Non GenAI Savvy 
   2. GenAI Savvy
3. 3rd party services
   1. GPU hardware suppliers: Nvidia, Intel, AMD etc
   2. Server and networking equipment suppliers: SuperMicro etc.
   3. Infra software providers: Linux, K8s etc
   4. Open source model providers: Meta Llama, Falcon, Mistral etc
   6. Proprietary LLM providers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic

## Unmet Needs
*Non GenAI Savvy GenAI solution consumers (Existing DO customers)*
  1. I hear a lot of buzz but I don’t know how GenAI can add value to my business (beyond using ChatGPT)
  2. I have a GenAI idea to improve my business but I don’t know how to productize it.

*ML Engineers (New DO customers)*
  1. Struggle to decide the best model for their use-case
  2. Shortage of data to train the model for my use-cases. Data collection is laborious
  3. Model training takes a long time and is very expensive
  4. Model testing is actual customer environments is time-consuming and delays my launch
  5. Implementation of multimodal use-cases is a big challenge
  6. How do I make best use of AI agents for my business
  7. Worried about losing customer trust because of GenAI hallucination or irresponsible use of AI
