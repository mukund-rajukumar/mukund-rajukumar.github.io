# AI based Elderly Fall Monitoring System

## Overview
A home based fall detection and notification system to keep seniors safe in their homes.

## Why are we building the product?
Every 20 seconds, a senior suffers a fatal fall. Seniors face higher fall risks due to aging muscles, diminishing balance and slower reaction times.

## AI Hypothesis
If I deliver a automatic fall detection and quick alerting system that is 99.9% accurate (<0.1% false alarms, misses) to the seniors and their families, the seniors can live independently knowing that in case of an emergency, immediate help will be on it way and the families will be less worried for the safety of their elders, which in turn saves the family $1500-$2000 per month they have to spend of senior care facilities, of which I can capture 5% through a monthly subscription fee.
